🐍 Snake Maths – Gamified Arithmetic Learning App
Developed an educational game in Python using Pygame and Tkinter to improve arithmetic fluency for primary school pupils. Inspired by the classic Snake mechanic, players select the correct answer between two moving apples in response to dynamically generated maths questions. Users can choose from categories (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) before gameplay begins.

The system features progressive difficulty scaling, a timer-based pressure mechanism, and a login/registration system with leaderboard tracking to enhance replayability. Designed with a focus on user engagement, GUI responsiveness, and learning psychology.
