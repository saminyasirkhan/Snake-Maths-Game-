Developed an educational game in Python using Pygame and Tkinter, designed to help primary school pupils improve their arithmetic fluency through interactive gameplay.

The game is inspired by the classic Snake mechanic and challenges players to answer randomly generated maths questions by selecting the correct answer among two moving apple objects. The correct and incorrect values are dynamically generated based on the question displayed at the top of the screen.

The player selects a category (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) before the game begins, allowing targeted skill practice. The system uses a modular question generation script that scales in complexity based on the user’s performance. A timer mechanism is integrated to increase pressure and difficulty, reducing time windows as scores rise.

To enhance accessibility and progression tracking, a user authentication system was implemented using a login and registration module. Player scores are stored and displayed on a leaderboard, promoting healthy competition and encouraging replayability.

Particular attention was given to GUI responsiveness, real-time user feedback, and the psychological principles behind gamified learning, ensuring that the system remains intuitive while delivering educational value.
